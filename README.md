# Image Slider

This is a simple Image Slider built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The slider allows users to move between images using next and previous buttons. It also changes images automatically after a few seconds.

## Features

* Next and previous buttons
* Automatic image sliding
* Smooth sliding effect using CSS transform
* Looping from last image back to first
* Simple and clean design

## What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

* DOM manipulation
* Event listeners
* Working with setTimeout
* Controlling slide index logic
* Using CSS transform with JavaScript

This project helped me understand how JavaScript controls animations and updates the UI dynamically.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How It Works

* The slider keeps track of the current image using a slide index
* When next or previous is clicked, the index updates
* The transform property moves the image container
* setTimeout is used to automatically move to the next image after a few seconds
* When the last image is reached, it loops back to the first image

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser
2. Click the next and previous buttons to change images
3. Wait a few seconds to see automatic sliding
